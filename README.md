# UGAStaffSalaries
Interactive web app displaying comparison of histogram and boxplot animations of the distribution UGA staff salaries, according to occupation title categorization, along with sorted data tables of over 10 fiscal years (2011â€“2021)

From conception to completion, base program (consisting of data clean up, histogram animation, and sorted data tables) was created within 6 days using the PyWebIO package without any prior experience with the package. Box plot animations were later added.

Aggregated, cleansed, and combined data from public data sources for analysis with MS SQL, having only started learning SQL less than 2 weeks prior.
